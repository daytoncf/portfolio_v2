# portfolio_v2
Remaking my portfolio to practice my CSS skillz and give it a more modern look.

# Motivation
I thought it'd be a good idea to throw together a good looking portfolio that'll showcase all of the projects I've worked on. I'm hoping this will help me standout as a candidate now that I'm embarking on my software engineering career.
